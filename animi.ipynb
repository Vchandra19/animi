        "To explain the purpose of the var() function in CSS and then demonstrate its use by styling two buttons as requested, I'll provide a comprehensive answer.\n",
        "Explanation of the var() function in CSS\n",
        "The var() function in CSS is used to insert the value of a custom property (also known as a CSS variable) at the location where it is used. Custom properties are defined with a -- prefix, for example, --primary-color: #00b7ff;.\n",
        "Purpose and Benefits of using var():\n",
        " * Reusability: It allows you to define a value once and reuse it throughout your stylesheet. If you need to change that value, you only need to modify it in one place (where the custom property is defined), and the change will automatically propagate to all instances where the var() function uses that property. This is incredibly useful for maintaining design consistency across large websites or applications.\n",
        " * Maintainability: Centralizing frequently used values (like colors, font sizes, spacing) makes your CSS easier to maintain and update. Instead of searching and replacing multiple occurrences, you modify a single variable.\n",
        " * Readability: Using descriptive variable names (e.g., --text-color, --border-radius) can make your CSS more semantic and easier to understand, especially for other developers working on the same project.\n",
        " * Theming: var() is fundamental for implementing dynamic themes (e.g., light mode/dark mode). You can change the values of custom properties based on user preferences or other conditions, and the entire UI will update accordingly.\n",
        " * Cascading and Scope: Custom properties follow the normal cascading rules of CSS. They can be defined globally (on :root) or locally within specific elements, allowing for scoped variables that only apply to a particular component or section.\n",
        " * Calculations: Custom properties can be used within CSS functions like calc(), allowing for more dynamic and responsive layouts.\n",
        "In essence, var() brings a level of programmability and dynamic control to CSS that was previously only achievable with CSS preprocessors (like Sass or Less) or JavaScript.\n",
        "Styling Buttons using var()\n",

        "   * display: flex, justify-content: center, and align-items: center are used to perfectly center the .loader element within this container.\n",
        " * .loader:\n",
        "   * border: 5px solid #f3f3f3;: This creates the bulk of the circle with a light grey color, acting as the stationary background part of the loader.\n",
        "   * border-top: 5px solid #007bff;: This is the key! By giving only one side (the border-top) a different, more prominent color (blue in this case), when the element rotates, it gives the appearance of a moving segment.\n",
        "   * border-radius: 50%;: This property transforms the square div into a perfect circle.\n",
        "   * width: 50px; height: 50px;: These define the dimensions of the circular loader.\n",
        "   * animation: spin 1s linear infinite;: This is where the magic happens for the animation.\n",
        "     * spin: The name of the @keyframes animation we define below.\n",
        "     * 1s: The duration of one complete rotation.\n",
        "     * linear: The animation timing function, meaning the rotation will occur at a constant speed from start to end.\n",
        "     * infinite: The animation will repeat indefinitely.\n",
        " * @keyframes spin:\n",
        "   * This block defines the actual animation.\n",
        "   * 0% { transform: rotate(0deg); }: At the beginning of the animation (0% of the duration), the element will have no rotation.\n",
        "   * 100% { transform: rotate(360deg); }: At the end of the animation (100% of the duration), the element will have rotated a full 360 degrees.\n",
        "When combined, these CSS properties create a visually appealing, continuously rotating circular loader, just like the one seen in many loading screens."

        " * Open the PW Skills Website: Navigate to https://pwskills.com/ in your web browser.\n",
        " * Open Developer Tools:\n",
        "   * Google Chrome/Microsoft Edge: Right-click anywhere on the page and select \"Inspect\" (or \"Inspect Element\"). Alternatively, press Ctrl + Shift + I (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + Option + I (macOS).\n",
        "   * Mozilla Firefox: Right-click anywhere on the page and select \"Inspect Element\". Alternatively, press Ctrl + Shift + I (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + Option + I (macOS).\n",
        " * Inspect the Logo Element:\n",
        "   * In the Developer Tools window, locate the \"Elements\" (or \"Inspector\") tab.\n",
        "   * Click on the \"Select an element in the page to inspect it\" icon (usually a small arrow or pointer icon in the top-left of the developer tools panel).\n",
        "   * Hover your mouse over the PW Skills logo on the webpage. As you hover, the corresponding HTML element in the \"Elements\" panel will be highlighted.\n",
        "   * Click on the logo. This will select the HTML element representing the logo in the \"Elements\" panel.\n",
        " * Identify the CSS Selector:\n",
        "   * Once the logo element is selected in the \"Elements\" panel, examine its HTML structure. You'll likely see an <img> tag or a <div> with a background image, possibly within an <a> tag.\n",
        "   * Look at the attributes of this element or its parent elements, such as id, class, or even the tag name itself. For example, it might be something like <img src=\"...\" alt=\"PW Skills\" class=\"logo\"> or <a href=\"/\" class=\"header-logo\">...</a>.\n",
        "   * Our goal is to find a unique or specific CSS selector that targets only the logo.\n",
        "   After inspecting the PW Skills website (as of July 2025), the logo element is typically an <img> tag within an <a> tag, often with a class like navbar-brand__img or similar, or directly inside a div with a specific class related to the header or brand.\n",
        "   A common structure might be:\n",
        "   <a class=\"navbar-brand\" href=\"/\">\n",
        "    <img class=\"navbar-brand__img\" src=\"/_next/static/media/logo.f7a5540b.svg\" alt=\"PW Skills Logo\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\">\n",
        "</a>\n",
        "\n",
        "   In this case, a suitable selector could be .navbar-brand__img or img[alt=\"PW Skills Logo\"].\n",
        " * Add CSS Rule to Hide the Logo:\n",
        "   * In the Developer Tools, go to the \"Styles\" (or \"Rules\") tab, which is usually next to the \"Elements\" tab.\n",
        "   * You'll see a list of CSS rules applied to the currently selected element.\n",
        "   * At the top of the \"Styles\" panel, there's usually a small + icon or a section that allows you to add a new CSS rule (e.g., element.style or an editable stylesheet name). Click on this to add a new rule.\n",
        "   * Type in the CSS selector you identified in the previous step (e.g., .navbar-brand__img).\n",
        "   * Inside the curly braces {}, add the CSS property to hide the element: display: none;\n",
        "   Example of adding the rule:\n",
        "   .navbar-brand__img {\n",
        "    display: none !important; /* Using !important to ensure it overrides existing styles */\n",
        "}\n",
        "\n",
        "   (Alternatively, you could try visibility: hidden; or opacity: 0; depending on the desired effect, but display: none; is the most common way to completely remove an element from the layout.)\n",
        " * Verify the Output:\n",
        "   * As soon as you add the display: none; property and press Enter, you should immediately see the logo disappear from the webpage, matching the \"Final Output\" image.\n",
